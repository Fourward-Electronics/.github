## Project description
In this project, we have created an IT service proposal for a fictional startup company that is looking to add new employees and to grow their computer network. This company is in the space industry, where they engineer, build, and deploy micro-satellites. (Hence we have affectionately dubbed our fictional client as "Space O".)

In this scenario, our client is looking for solutions that allow the following:
- streamlined, rapid provisioning of fully customized and configured Windows 10 endpoints
- secure remote access functionality for company employees
- ability to share and backup files over the network
- secure backup and storage of data in offsite locations
- automation of tedious routine tasks such as user provisioning and file backup

The attached Github repositories contain the following:
- Project Prep Docs: documentation completed in preparation for this project
- Scripts: Windows and Ubuntu scripts and configuration files that address the automation needs
- SOPs: our presentation slides, relevant diagrams/topologies, and Standard Operating Procedures that we would use to support the customer in an ongoing business relationship
